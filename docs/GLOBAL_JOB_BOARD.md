## âœ… Implementation Complete!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Concept: Freelance Marketplace**

```
Flow:
1. AI Generator â†’ Generate Projects
   â†“
2. Save to GLOBAL JOB BOARD (user_id = NULL)
   â†“
3. All Players Browse Available Jobs
   â†“
4. Accept Job â†’ Becomes Personal Project
   â†“
5. Work on Project â†’ Complete â†’ Claim Reward
```

---

## ðŸ”§ **Changes Made:**

### **Database:**
- âœ… `projects.user_id` â†’ **Nullable** (NULL = Global job)
- âœ… `projects.company_id` â†’ **Nullable** (NULL = Not assigned yet)
- âœ… `projects.status` â†’ `'available'` for global jobs

### **Backend Routes:**
```php
GET  /api/projects/available        // Get global jobs
POST /api/projects/{id}/accept      // Accept a job
```

### **Backend Logic:**
- **AI Generator** â†’ Saves with `user_id = NULL`, `status = 'available'`
- **Browse Jobs** â†’ Shows only jobs with `user_id IS NULL`
- **Accept Job** â†’ Sets `user_id`, `company_id`, changes status to `'queued'`

### **Frontend:**
- **"ðŸ¤– Browse AI Jobs"** button â†’ Opens job board modal
- Shows **AI-generated jobs** instead of templates
- **"âœ… Accept Job"** button â†’ Claims job for user
- Reputation locking still works
- Empty state â†’ Redirects to AI Generator
