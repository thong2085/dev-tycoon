## ðŸ“Š **Example Conversation:**

```
Player: "How do I scale my team?"

AI Mentor: "Great question! Based on your current setup with 3 employees 
at Company Level 8, here's my advice: Focus on hiring specialists first - 
a dedicated Frontend Dev and Backend Dev will give you more productivity 
than general developers. Also, consider your cash flow - make sure your 
revenue can cover their salaries before hiring!"

Player: "What about burnout management?"

AI Mentor: "Burnout is real in the dev world! ðŸ˜… I noticed you've completed 
12 projects - excellent work! My tip: use the Auto Rest feature to keep 
employee energy above 30%. Also, take breaks yourself - even tycoons need 
to sleep sometimes! Your company runs even when you're offline, so don't 
feel guilty about logging off."
```
